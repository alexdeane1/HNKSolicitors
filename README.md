## Changes

I changed the view width on the header to 90 instead of the design so that I could make the hamburger menu show at a lesser width.

On the sections with the questions like "Have you had a slip, trip or fall?", I was not sure what the boxes where. I assumed they would be links and not dropdown boxes.

## Things I didnt finish

There are a few things I did not finish in time

I did not finish the accordian. the accordian works, but i did not make it responsive. The pagination section was also not finished.

I did not finish the "Why Choose us Section. I did not make the image as responsive as I wanted to.

I did not finish the hero section. The image was not responsive

The navigation is responsive, but i was not able to finish it so the hamburger menu is animated, but does not work

## Changes after submission

I changed the website to make it responsive throughout the whole website. This includes the accordian, and the why choose us section

I finished the navigation, so that it now works
